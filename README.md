# Vadim Rahmanov test task

## Gettings started

### Requirements

Make sure you have installed:
1. **Shopify CLI**
2. **Node.js 22.18.0**

If you are using **NVM**, simply run:

```bash
nvm use
```

### Installation

```bash
npm i
```

### Running the Project

Run the following command to start development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the project in development mode.

P.S. I am aware that storing API keys directly in the package files is not great. However, for simplicity and for this test project, I have put them there.
